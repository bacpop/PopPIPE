# PopPIPE
Population analysis PIPEline ðŸ› ðŸ§¬

Downstream analysis of [PopPUNK](https://www.poppunk.net/) results.

## Pipeline description

The pipeline consists of the following steps:
- Split files into their [PopPUNK](https://www.poppunk.net/) strains.
- Use [pp-sketchlib](https://github.com/johnlees/pp-sketchlib) to calculate core and accessory distances within each strain.
- Use core distances and [rapidnj](https://birc.au.dk/software/rapidnj/) to make a neighbour-joining tree.
- (hclust mode) Generate clusters from core distances with hierarchical clustering in [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.AgglomerativeClustering.html).
- Use [ska](https://github.com/simonrharris/SKA) to generate within-strain alignments.
- Use [IQ-TREE](http://www.iqtree.org/) to generate an ML phylogeny using this alignment, and the NJ tree as a starting point.
- Use [fastbaps](https://github.com/gtonkinhill/fastbaps) to generate subclusters which are partitions of the phylogeny.
- Create an overall visualisation with both core and accessory distances, as in PopPUNK.

### Example pipeline DAG

**TODO**

## Installation

The supported method is to use conda, which is most easily accessed by first
installing [miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html). PopPIPE simply depends
upon snakemake:
```
conda install snakemake
```

Other dependencies will be automatically installed by conda the first time
you run the pipeline.

If the package cannot be found you will need to add the necessary channels:
```
conda config --add channels defaults
conda config --add channels bioconda
conda config --add channels conda-forge
```

## Usage

1. Modify `config.yml` as appropriate.
2. Run `snakemake --cores <n_cores> --use-conda`.

On a cluster or the cloud, you can use snakemake's built-in `--cluster` argument:
```
snakemake --cluster qsub -j 16 --use-conda
```
See the [snakemake docs](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/executing/cluster-cloud.html) 
for more information on your cluster/cloud provider.

## Config file

### PopPIPE configuration

* `script_location`: The `scripts/` directory, if not running from the root of this repository
* `poppunk_db`: The PopPUNK HDF5 database file, without the `.h5` suffix.
* `poppunk_clusters`: The PopPUNK cluster CSV file, usually `poppunk_db/poppunk_db_clusters.csv`.
* `poppunk_rfile`: The `--rfile` used with PopPUNK, which lists sample names and files, one per line, tab separated.
* `min_cluster_size`: The minimum size of a cluster to run the analysis on (recommended at least 6).

### IQ-TREE configuration

* `enabled`: Set to `false` to turn off ML tree generation, and use the NJ tree throughout.
* `mode`: Set to `full` to run with the specified model, set to `fast` to run using `--fast` (like fasttree).
* `model`: A string for the `-m` parameter describing the model. Adding `+ASC` is recommended.

### fastbaps configuration

* `levels`: Number of levels of recursive subclustering.
* `script`: Location of the `run_fastbaps` script. Find by running `system.file("run_fastbaps", package = "fastbaps")` in R.

### Alternative runs

For quick and dirty clustering and phylogenies using core distances from
[pp-sketchlib](https://github.com/johnlees/pp-sketchlib) alone, run:
```
snakemake --cores <n_cores> --use-conda hclust
```

To create a visualisation on [microreact](https://microreact.org/):
```
snakemake --use-conda make_microreact
```

## Updating a run
Running `snakemake` from the same directory will keep outputs where possible,
so new additions will automatically be included.

**TODO**: How to do this when adding new isolates
